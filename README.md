# Bad Commits Demo

This repo is an example of how **not** to write Git commit messages.

Every commit in this project breaks some kind of best practice:
- Vague messages like `stuff` and `more`
- No structure or context
- Unrelated changes in a single commit
- Messy, hard-to-follow history

### Whatâ€™s in the project?

A basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript page with:
- A heading
- A button
- Some minimal styles and scripts

Nothing fancy â€” the point is to show how even small projects can become confusing without clear commits.

### ðŸš« Why you shouldn't commit like this

Poor commit hygiene makes it hard to:
- Track changes
- Revert bugs
- Collaborate on a team
- Understand *why* something was changed
